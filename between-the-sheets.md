# Between the Sheets

## Dealing
- As you deal, make three stacks
    - The first and third stack will always have a card placed on them
        - If an Ace is flipped as the first card, pause to allow the player to decide if the Ace is high or low
    - Deal a card to the third stack only when the player bids

## The Rules
- Typically, players will ante somewhere around 5-10 times the usual ante to build up an initial pot
- The dealer will flip two cards face up, and the player will bid if they think the next card will be between the first two (exclusive)
    - Typically, the first time around, players can only bid their ante
    - After the first time around, players can bid up to the total amount in the pot
- The dealer will then flip over another card if a bid was made
    - If a player bids and the next card is between the two cards, the player takes the bid amount from the pot
    - If a player bids and the next card is outside of the two cards, the player pays the bid amount to the pot
    - If a player bids and the next card matches one of the two cards, the player pays double the bid amount to the pot
- Continue until the deck has been gone through twice, then play a game of 5 Card Draw for the remainder of the pot
