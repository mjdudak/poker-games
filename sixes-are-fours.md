# Fours are Wild, Sixes are Fours

## The Rules
- It's 5 Card Draw, but fours are wild and sixes are fours.
    - A six that changes to a four is just a four. It's not wild. Come on, now.
    - An acceptable variant is "Sixes are Wild, Fours are Sixes" when you've had a few drinks and want to get crazy.
- This is the best game.
